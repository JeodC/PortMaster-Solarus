# Solarus for PortMaster
## Introduction
The Solarus RPG game engine set up to run with PortMaster. Many retro handheld firmwares have Solarus built in, but some do not. Further, built-in Solarus is at the mercy of provided firmware libraries and joystick configs.
By running Solarus through PortMaster, we can provide additional libraries as needed and customize controls via GPtoKeyB (Gamepad to Keyboard emulation).

## Usage
Unzip to `roms/ports` folder. Games (the `.solarus` files) need to be downloaded separately and added to the `ports/{game}` folder.  

Find the games on the [Solarus Website](https://solarus-games.org/games/).
